## Deploy LogPaste to Amazon LightSail

Amazon LightSail is an attractive option for launching LogPaste to production for two main reasons:

- You can deploy entirely from Amazon's AWS dashboard, so you don't need to install any software.
- You can view LogPaste's server logs directly from your AWS dashboard.
- LightSail offers free TLS certificates for a custom domain.

The downside is that it doesn't fit within AWS's free tier, so hosting will cost $7 per month, as of this writing.

## Pre-requisites

You'll need:

- An Amazon AWS account
- A storage bucket and [IAM credentials](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) on Amazon S3 or an S3-compatible storage service.

## Create a LogPaste container

Visit [Amazon LightSail's container management dashboard](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/webapp/home/containers)

<kbd>

</kbd>

Enter the following information for your custom deployment:

- Container name: Choose whatever name you want, such as `yourcompany-logpaste`
- Image: `mtlynch/logpaste:0.2.5` (or whatever the [latest LogPaste version](https://github.com/mtlynch/logpaste/releases) is)
- Launch command: _leave blank_
- Environment variables

| `LITESTREAM_REGION`            | The region of your S3 bucket                        |
| `LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | The AWS access key ID from your IAM credentials     |

Choose a name for your service (it can be the same as your container name):

</kbd>

Finally, click "Create container service."

## Completing deployment

As LightSail deploys your image, you'll see a status of "Pending" for the container.

<kbd>

</kbd>

It will take LightSail about three to five minutes to deploy your instance for the first time. When deployment is complete, it will show a status of "Running."

<kbd>

</kbd>

When your container is running, you can access it through the "Public domain" URL.

<kbd>

</kbd>

You can view server logs for your LogPaste instance by clicking "Open log" in the box next to your container.
