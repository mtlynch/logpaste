### Why serve logpaste with Traefik?
In LogPaste, it handles HTTP(S) traffic, and manages SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt, ensuring secure connections. This simplifies deployment by automating routing and SSL setup.

**Create `acme.json` file**:
   - Before starting the services, create an empty `acme.json` file in `/opt/traefik/` with proper permissions (`chmod 600 acme.json`). This file will store the SSL certificates.

### Docker Compose
The `docker-compose.yml` file already includes the required services for Traefik and LogPaste, with proper labels for routing and SSL.

```bash
# Docker Compose Command to Run LogPaste with Traefik
docker-compose up -d
```
